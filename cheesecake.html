		<h1>cheesecake</h1>
		<h3>cheesecake is often mistaken for a gooey, disgusting, cheesy dessert that is overall just revolting. but its not. if you would like to taste revolting, please visit one of the other pages on my website that talk about desserts like banana pudding, coconut cake, and jello. now, back to cheesecake. although there is a misconception about cheesecake, its actually quite delicious. It has an amazing texture and taste: a soft but not soggy texture in the cake part, with a harder but still easy to bite bottom. the taste is very hard to explain. its sweet but not too sweet, and doesn't actually taste that much like cheese.</h3>

		<p>overall, cheesecake is a very yummy dessert to eat, and its not as hard to make as pavlova, so i would definitely recommend trying it. my rating is:</p>

		<h2>23/10</h2>

		<p>cheesecake is an intermediate dessert when it comes to making it, so if you don't want to make it but would like to try it, cheesecake is generally pretty tasty in restaruants as well as your home. but of course, homemade is always better. here is a recipe for delicious homemade cheesecake: <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/classic-cheesecake/">sally's baking addiction homemade classic cheesecake</a><p>(as you may notice on the recipe, it says 7hr 45min, but that is due to the fact it requires cooling in the oven for one hour, and chilling overnight for up to four)
