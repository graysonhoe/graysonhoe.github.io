		<h1>pavlova</h1>
		<h3>pavlova is legitimately one of the best things you will ever put in your mouth--if you're lucky enough to get the chance. pavlova consistently exceeds expectations in ALL areas: texture, taste, and presentation. pavlova may look like a regular meringue, but its very different. it has a harder, sugary shell on the outside, but once you bite it, you'll be delighted to find a soft, spongey, also sugary inside. pavlova tastes amazing if you make it correctly (which is a bit difficult to do), and toppings like organic whipped cream, strawberries, and other berries always make it better. and of course, decorating pavlova with these various toppings is always fun.</h3>

		<p>as you can see, pavlova reigns supreme in the dessert world, and always tastes like heaven if made correctly. because of the texture, taste, and presentation factor of pavlova, my rating is...</p>
